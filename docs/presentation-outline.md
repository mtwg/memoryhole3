## Title
## The Hub
  - Information flows in from all support roles
  - <diagram>
## The Flow: Jail Support
  - How can we streamline access to this information?
  - Mobile app for onsite jail support
## The Flow: Hotline
  - Hotline users need to enter critical data rapidly
  - Hotline users need to be able to look up profiles rapidly
  - Hotline users need to be encouraged to capture the most critical information first
  - Hotline calls are not always arrestees - more nuanced ways to manage this
## Core Needs: Stability & Access
  - No downtime or call latency! *Only* land lines (for now)
  - (Non Tech) Operations support must provide resources for land lines
    - with round-robin dialing
    - that supports collect calls
  - Future: Custom VOIP implementation
    - Automate lookup of inbound caller
    - Easily & Securely record calls
    - "Cloud" availability & distributed hotline
## Core Needs: Anywhere, Anytime
  - 
## Core Needs: Scale up and down
  - High availability when the actions are happening
    - Support potentially hundreds of users at the same time
    -
  - Scale down for long term support and casework
